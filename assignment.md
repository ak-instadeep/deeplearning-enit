## Project Description

In this project you will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. 
After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

The data can be downloaded from here [[Traffic sign data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=136gJaJk0LVz52ScfbW2lzVUu744fxOBU)]

An Ipython notebook that contains further instructions and starter code is included in the repo. Be sure to download the Ipython notebook.

We also want you to create a detailed writeup of the project. Check the template in the repo.

To meet assignement, the project will require submitting three files:

* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file
